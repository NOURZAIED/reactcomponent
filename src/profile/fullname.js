            Hello, my name is ZAIED Nour and I am writing to introduce myself. My interests include coding, art, and music .
        In the past i used to work at a geomatic company, after that I choose to study web development Because most businesses require a full-stack Web developer for a variety of reasons. Web developers who are full-stack can work with a variety of technologies ,so I made some research on Gomycode . 
        and finally I started practicing to code in Gomycode with HTML,CSS Basics and developed my simple portfolio as one my beginners project containing my basic personal details .
